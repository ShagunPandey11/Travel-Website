## Travel Website (React Practice Project)

This is a simple travel-themed website I built while learning React. It’s a beginner-level project created to practice key front-end development skills like:

- Creating components
- Using React Router for a single-page application feel
- Working with props and custom attributes
- Building reusable layouts like Navbar and Footer

## What’s Inside

When you open the site, you’ll land on a homepage with a clean layout and a message:
**"Adventure Awaits — What Are You Waiting For?"**

Scroll down and you'll see featured destinations, each with images and simple hover effects. These cards are not clickable — they’re just for layout/design practice.

There’s also a basic navigation bar with links to:
- Home
- Services
- Products
- Sign Up

Only the Home page has detailed content. The other pages like Services and Products show static placeholder sections with just text or images.

The **About Us**, **Contact Us**, **Social media** and **Video** sections are present as text links in the footer but do not contain functional content. These were added for layout structure.

## Why I Built This

This project was created to demonstrate my ability to:
- Structure a basic website using React
- Use React Router for navigation
- Design and organize frontend content
- Apply simple effects and layout styling

It’s not a fully interactive website — it’s more of a sandbox where I learned and applied key frontend concepts. Think of it as a portfolio piece showing my growth in content development and UI building.
